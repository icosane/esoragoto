## About

[This site](https://esoragoto.herokuapp.com/) was developed as my course work, and it deals with modeling the Kuramoto's model.  
It runs on Heroku and is using mpld3, a web wrapper for matplotlib, which allows you to model graphs in real time.  
Using this repository you can deploy your own instance and customize it to your liking.

If something doesn't work, update the requirements and pray that it will work. I actually didn't test the heroku deploy button. ヾ(•ω•`)o
