## About

[This site](https://esoragoto.herokuapp.com/) was developed as my course work, and it deals with the Kuramoto's model of synchronization.  
It runs on Heroku and is using mpld3, a web wrapper for matplotlib, which allows you to build graphs in real time.  
Using this repository you can deploy your own instance of my work and customize it to your liking.

### Kuramoto model

The Kuramoto model is a mathematical model used to describe synchronization. More specifically, it is a model for the behavior of a large set of coupled oscillators. The model makes several assumptions, including that there is weak coupling, that the oscillators are identical or nearly identical, and that interactions depend sinusoidally on the phase difference between each pair of objects. In the most popular version of the Kuramoto model, each of the oscillators is considered to have its own intrinsic natural frequency w
, and each is coupled equally to all other oscillators. Surprisingly, this fully nonlinear model can be solved exactly in the limit of infinite oscillators, N→ ∞; alternatively, using self-consistency arguments one may obtain steady-state solutions of the order parameter.
